Papers Database 
----------------------------------

Waiting for better AI tools for papers reccomendation the Continual AI community is mantaining a database of CL papers which we plan to realease soon. It would be very rich of metadata so that we can better navigate the incredible number of papers published each year (query example: give me the papers employing reharsal and evaluated on CORe50).

Please add your own paper below so that we can advertise it and insert in our CL database!
