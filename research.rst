Research
================================

In the last few years we have witnessed a renewed and steadily growing interest in the ability to learn continuously from high-dimensional data. In this page, we will try to keep track of recent **Continual/Lifelong** Learning developments in a pure research context.

Research Programs
----------------------------------

In this section we keep track of all the current and past projects on Lifelong/Continual Learning.:

- DARPA Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M) program
- European H2020 DREAM project


Papers Database 
----------------------------------

Waiting for better AI tools for papers reccomendation the Continual AI community is mantaining a database of CL papers which we plan to realease soon. It would be very rich of metadata so that we can better navigate the incredible number of papers published each year (query example: give me the papers employing reharsal and evaluated on CORe50).

Please add your own paper below so that we can advertise it and insert in our CL database!
