Software and Data
================================

One of the most important objective of the Continual AI project is to provide an easy access to Continual Learning both in terms of didactic materials and open software/datasets for business/research. In this page we will try to collect every open-source project related to Continual Learning.

Software
--------------------------------

- `NORB sequencer <https://github.com/vlomonaco/norb-creator>`_: Java application (with GUI) to make small videos out of the NORB dataset.
- `GEM implementation <https://github.com/facebookresearch/GradientEpisodicMemory>`_: Implementation of the CL strategy “Gradient Episodic Memory”.
- `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_: Open source interface that provides a ready-to-use suite of reinforcement learning tasks for evaluating performance of your algorithm.
- `DeepMind Lab <https://github.com/deepmind/lab>`_: 3D learning environment that provides a suite of challenging 3D navigation and puzzle-solving tasks for learning agents.
- `DEN <https://github.com/jaehong-yoon93/DEN>`_: TensorFlow implementation of the CL strategy “Dynamically Expandable Networks”.


Datasets and Benchmarks
--------------------------------

- `CORe50 benchmark <https://github.com/vlomonaco/core50>`_: Continual Learning benchmark for object recognition and robotics.
- `Visual Domain Decathlon <https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/decathlon/>`_: Ten image classification problems representative of very different visual domains.
