abstract = {Humans and animals can learn complex predictive models that allow them to accurately and reliably reason about real-world phenomena, and they can adapt such models extremely quickly in the face of unexpected changes. Deep neural network models allow us to represent very complex functions, but lack this capacity for rapid online adaptation. The goal in this paper is to develop a method for continual online learning from an incoming stream of data, using deep neural network models. We formulate an online learning procedure that uses stochastic gradient descent to update model parameters, and an expectation maximization algorithm with a Chinese restaurant process prior to develop and maintain a mixture of models to handle non-stationary task distributions. This allows for all models to be adapted as necessary, with new models instantiated for task changes and old models recalled when previously seen tasks are encountered again. Furthermore, we observe that meta-learning can be used to meta-train a model such that this direct online adaptation with SGD is effective, which is otherwise not the case for large function approximators. In this work, we apply our meta-learning for online learning (MOLe) approach to model-based reinforcement learning, where adapting the predictive model is critical for control; we demonstrate that MOLe outperforms alternative prior methods, and enables effective continuous adaptation in non-stationary task distributions such as varying terrains, motor failures, and unexpected disturbances.

abstract = {Learning from non-stationary data remains a great challenge for machine learning. Continual learning addresses this problem in scenarios where the learning agent faces a stream of changing tasks. In these scenarios, the agent is expected to retain its highest performance on previous tasks without revisiting them while adapting well to the new tasks. Two new recent continual-learning scenarios have been proposed. In meta-continual learning, the model is pre-trained to minimize catastrophic forgetting when trained on a sequence of tasks. In continual-meta learning, the goal is faster remembering, i.e., focusing on how quickly the agent recovers performance rather than measuring the agent's performance without any adaptation. Both scenarios have the potential to propel the field forward. Yet in their original formulations, they each have limitations. As a remedy, we propose a more general scenario where an agent must quickly solve (new) out-of-distribution tasks, while also requiring fast remembering. We show that current continual learning, meta learning, meta-continual learning, and continual-meta learning techniques fail in this new scenario. Accordingly, we propose a strong baseline: Continual-MAML, an online extension of the popular MAML algorithm. In our empirical experiments, we show that our method is better suited to the new scenario than the methodologies mentioned above, as well as standard continual learning and meta learning approaches.},

abstract = {While neural networks are powerful function approximators, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting when the data distribution is not stationary. One particular formalism that studies learning under non-stationary distribution is provided by continual learning, where the non-stationarity is imposed by a sequence of distinct tasks. Most methods in this space assume, however, the knowledge of task boundaries, and focus on alleviating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we depart from this view and move the focus towards faster remembering – i.e measuring how quickly the network recovers performance rather than measuring the network's performance without any adaptation. We argue that in many settings this can be more effective and that it opens the door to combining meta-learning and continual learning techniques, leveraging their complementary advantages. We propose a framework specific for the scenario where no information about task boundaries or task identity is given. It relies on a separation of concerns into what task is being solved and how the task should be solved. This framework is implemented by differentiating task specific parameters from task agnostic parameters, where the latter are optimized in a continual meta learning fashion, without access to multiple tasks at the same time. We showcase this framework in a supervised learning scenario and discuss the implication of the proposed formalism.},

abstract = {Online continual learning (OCL) refers to the ability of a system to learn over time from a continuous stream of data without having to revisit previously encountered training samples. Learning continually in a single data pass is crucial for agents and robots operating in changing environments and required to acquire, fine-tune, and transfer increasingly complex representations from non-i.i.d. input distributions. Machine learning models that address OCL must alleviate \textit{catastrophic forgetting} in which hidden representations are disrupted or completely overwritten when learning from streams of novel input. In this chapter, we summarize and discuss recent deep learning models that address OCL on sequential input through the use (and combination) of synaptic regularization, structural plasticity, and experience replay. Different implementations of replay have been proposed that alleviate catastrophic forgetting in connectionists architectures via the re-occurrence of (latent representations of) input sequences and that functionally resemble mechanisms of hippocampal replay in the mammalian brain. Empirical evidence shows that architectures endowed with experience replay typically outperform architectures without in (online) incremental learning tasks.},

abstract = {Continual lifelong learning requires an agent or model to learn many sequentially ordered tasks, building on previous knowledge without catastrophically forgetting it. Much work has gone towards preventing the default tendency of machine learning models to catastrophically forget, yet virtually all such work involves manually-designed solutions to the problem. We instead advocate meta-learning a solution to catastrophic forgetting, allowing AI to learn to continually learn. Inspired by neuromodulatory processes in the brain, we propose A Neuromodulated Meta-Learning Algorithm (ANML). It differentiates through a sequential learning process to meta-learn an activation-gating function that enables context-dependent selective activation within a deep neural network. Specifically, a neuromodulatory (NM) neural network gates the forward pass of another (otherwise normal) neural network called the prediction learning network (PLN). The NM network also thus indirectly controls selective plasticity (i.e. the backward pass of) the PLN. ANML enables continual learning without catastrophic forgetting at scale: it produces state-of-the-art continual learning performance, sequentially learning as many as 600 classes (over 9,000 SGD updates).},

On the contrary, we propose to directly address the problem using recent developments in the space of continual learning for neural models.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies continual learning to conversation systems. We verified the efficacy of our method through a conversational skill transfer from either synthetic dialogs or human-human dialogs to human-computer conversations in a customer support domain.},

In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed for continual learning, but due to differences in evaluation protocols it is difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more structured comparisons, we describe three continual learning scenarios based on whether at test time task identity is provided and–in case it is not–whether it must be inferred. Any sequence of well-defined tasks can be performed according to each scenario. Using the split and permuted MNIST task protocols, for each scenario we carry out an extensive comparison of recently proposed continual learning methods. We demonstrate substantial differences between the three scenarios in terms of difficulty and in terms of how efficient different methods are. In particular, when task identity must be inferred (i.e., class incremental learning), we find that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) fail and that replaying representations of previous experiences seems required for solving this scenario.},

And transfer learning is often used when those existing systems are adapted to the target domain, e.g., fine-tuning, retraining. However, in the processes, the system parameters may well deviate too much from the previously learned parameters. Thus, it is difficult for the system training process to learn knowledge from target domains meanwhile not forgetting knowledge from the previous learning process, which is called as catastrophic forgetting (CF). In this paper, we attempt to solve the CF problem with the lifelong learning and propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) training framework for ASR. It considers reserving original knowledge and learning new knowledge as two independent tasks, respectively. On the one hand, we constrain the new parameters not to deviate too far from the original parameters and punish the new system when forgetting original knowledge. On the other hand, we force the new system to solve new knowledge quickly. Then, a MTL mechanism is employed to get the balance between the two tasks. We applied our method to an End2End ASR task and obtained the best performance in both target and original datasets.},

A hard attention mask is learned concurrently to every task, through stochastic gradient descent, and previous masks are exploited to condition such learning. We show that the proposed mechanism is effective for reducing catastrophic forgetting , cutting current rates by 45 to 80%.

This is most evident in the usually large gap between single-head and multi-head performance of continual learning models. We propose in this paper two strategies to improve performance of continual learning models, particularly in the single-head framework and for image classification tasks. First, we argue that learning multiple binary classifiers, rather than a single multi-class classifier, for each presentation of data is more consistent with the single-head framework. Moreover, we argue that auxiliary, unlabelled data can be used in tandem with this approach to slow the decay in performance of these binary classifiers over time.},

To address the problem, we propose a lifelong learning framework for neural topic modeling that can continuously process streams of document collections, accumulate topics and guide future topic modeling tasks by knowledge transfer from several sources to better deal with the sparse data. In the lifelong process, we particularly investigate jointly: (1) sharing generative homologies (latent topics) over lifetime to transfer prior knowledge, and (2) minimizing catastrophic forgetting to retain the past learning via novel selective data augmentation, co-training and topic regularization approaches. Given a stream of document collections, we apply the proposed Lifelong Neural Topic Modeling (LNTM) framework in modeling three sparse document collections as future tasks and demonstrate improved performance quantified by perplexity, topic coherence and information retrieval task.},

abstract = {Approaches to continual learning aim to successfully learn a set of related tasks that arrive in an online manner. Recently, several frameworks have been developed which enable deep learning to be deployed in this learning scenario. A key modelling decision is to what extent the architecture should be shared across tasks. On the one hand, separately modelling each task avoids catastrophic forgetting but it does not support transfer learning and leads to large models. On the other hand, rigidly specifying a shared component and a task-specific part enables task transfer and limits the model size, but it is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting and restricts the form of task-transfer that can occur. Ideally, the network should adaptively identify which parts of the network to share in a data driven way. Here we introduce such an approach called Continual Learning with Adaptive Weights (CLAW), which is based on probabilistic modelling and variational inference. Experiments show that CLAW achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks in terms of overall continual learning performance, as measured by classification accuracy, and in terms of addressing catastrophic forgetting.},

abstract = {Machine learning is one of several approaches to artificial intelligence. It allows us to build machines that can learn from experience as opposed to being explicitly programmed. Current machine learning formulations are mostly designed for learning and performing a particular task from a tabula rasa using data available for that task. For machine learning to converge to artificial intelligence, in addition to other desiderata, it must be in a state of continual learning, i.e., have the ability to be in a continuous learning process, such that when a new task is presented, the system can leverage prior knowledge from prior tasks, in learning and performing this new task, and augment the prior knowledge with the newly acquired knowledge without having a significant adverse effect on the prior knowledge. Continual learning is key to advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence. Deep learning is a powerful general-purpose approach to machine learning that is able to solve numerous and various tasks with minimal modification. Deep learning extends machine learning, and specially neural networks, to learn multiple levels of distributed representations together with the required mapping function into a single composite function. The emergence of deep learning and neural networks as a generic approach to machine learning, coupled with their ability to learn versatile hierarchical representations, has paved the way for continual learning. The main aim of this thesis is the study and development of a structured approach to continual learning, leveraging the success of deep learning and neural networks. This thesis studies the application of deep learning to a number of supervised learning tasks, and in particular, classification tasks in machine perception, e.g., image recognition, automatic speech recognition, and speech emotion recognition. The relation between the systems developed for these tasks is investigated to illuminate the layer-wise relevance of features in deep networks trained for these tasks via transfer learning, and these independent systems are unified into continual learning systems. The main contribution of this thesis is the construction and formulation of a deep learning framework, denoted progressive learning, that allows a holistic and systematic approach to continual learning. Progressive learning comprises a number of procedures that address the continual learning desiderata. It is shown that, when tasks are related, progressive learning leads to faster learning that converges to better generalization performance using less amounts of data and a smaller number of dedicated parameters, for the tasks studied in this thesis, by accumulating and leveraging knowledge learned across tasks in a continuous manner. It is envisioned that progressive learning is a step towards a fully general continual learning framework.},

abstract = {Interference is a known problem when learning in online settings, such as continual learning or reinforcement learning. Interference occurs when updates, to improve performance for some inputs, degrades performance for others. Recent work has shown that sparse representations---where only a small percentage of units are active---can significantly reduce interference. Those works, however, relied on relatively complex regularization or meta-learning approaches, that have only been used offline in a pre-training phase. In our approach, we design an activation function that naturally produces sparse representations, and so is much more amenable to online training. The idea relies on the simple approach of binning, but overcomes the two key limitations of binning: zero gradients for the flat regions almost everywhere, and lost precision---reduced discrimination---due to coarse aggregation. We introduce a Leaky Tiling Activation (LTA) that provides non-negligible gradients and produces overlap between bins that improves discrimination. We empirically investigate both value-based and policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms that use neural networks with LTAs, in classic discrete-action control environments and Mujoco continuous-action environments. We show that, with LTAs, learning is faster, with more stable policies, without needing target networks.},

The extended Auto-Sklearn is combined with concept drift detection techniquesthat allow it to automatically determine when the initial models have to be adapted.

However, as the number of tasks grows, storing and retraining on such data becomes infeasible. A new problem arises where we add new capabilities to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but the training data for its existing capabilities are unavailable. We propose our Learning without Forgetting method, which uses only new task data to train the network while preserving the original capabilities. Our method performs favorably compared to commonly used feature extraction and ﬁne-tuning adaption techniques and performs similarly to multitask learning that uses original task data we assume unavailable. A more surprising observation is that Learning without Forgetting may be able to replace ﬁne-tuning with similar old and new task datasets for improved new task performance.},

For a deployed system that must learn online from an uncontrolled and unknown environment, the ordering of input samples often fails to meet this criterion, making lifelong learning a difficult challenge. We exploit the locality of the unsupervised Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rule to target local representations in a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to adapt to novel information while protecting essential information in the remainder of the SNN from catastrophic forgetting. In our Controlled Forgetting Networks (CFNs), novel information triggers stimulated firing and heterogeneously modulated plasticity, inspired by biological dopamine signals, to cause rapid and isolated adaptation in the synapses of neurons associated with outlier information. This targeting controls the forgetting process in a way that reduces the degradation of accuracy for older tasks while learning new tasks. Our experimental results on the MNIST dataset validate the capability of CFNs to learn successfully over time from an unknown, changing environment, achieving 95.24% accuracy, which we believe is the best unsupervised accuracy ever achieved by a fixed-size, single-layer SNN on a completely disjoint MNIST dataset.},

These methods have arguably had their strongest impact on tasks such as image and audio processing - data processing domains in which humans have long held clear advantages over conventional algorithms. In contrast to biological neural systems, which are capable of learning continuously, deep artificial networks have a limited ability for incorporating new information in an already trained network. As a result, methods for continuous learning are potentially highly impactful in enabling the application of deep networks to dynamic data sets. Here, inspired by the process of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, we explore the potential for adding new neurons to deep layers of artificial neural networks in order to facilitate their acquisition of novel information while preserving previously trained data representations. Our results on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and the NIST SD 19 dataset, which includes lower and upper case letters and digits, demonstrate that neurogenesis is well suited for addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma that has long challenged adaptive machine learning algorithms.},

In this work we propose a new conceptualization of the continual learning problem in terms of a temporally symmetric trade-off between transfer and interference that can be optimized by enforcing gradient alignment across examples. We then propose a new algorithm, Meta-Experience Replay (MER), that directly exploits this view by combining experience replay with optimization based meta-learning. This method learns parameters that make interference based on future gradients less likely and transfer based on future gradients more likely. 1 We conduct experiments across continual lifelong supervised learning benchmarks and non-stationary reinforcement learning environments demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms recently proposed baselines for continual learning. Our experiments show that the gap between the performance of MER and baseline algorithms grows both as the environment gets more non-stationary and as the fraction of the total experiences stored gets smaller.},

This end-to-end learning model relies on the initial large dataset. However, many data are gradually obtained in practical situations, which contradict the deep learning of one-time batch learning. There is an urgent need for an incremental learning approach that can continuously learn new knowledge from new data while retaining what has already been learned. This paper proposes an incremental learning algorithm based on convolutional neural network and support vector data description. CNN and AM-Softmax loss function are used to represent and continuously learn image features. Support vector data description is used to construct multiple hyperspheres for new and old classes of images. Class-incremental learning is achieved by the increment of hyperspheres. The experimental results show that the incremental learning method proposed in this paper can effectively extract the latent features of the image and adapt it to the learning situation of the class-increment.

Much work has gone towards preventing the default tendency of machine learning models to catastrophically forget, yet virtually all such work involves manually-designed solutions to the problem. We instead advocate meta-learning a solution to catastrophic forgetting, allowing AI to learn to continually learn. Inspired by neuromodulatory processes in the brain, we propose A Neuromodulated Meta-Learning Algorithm (ANML). It differentiates through a sequential learning process to meta-learn an activation-gating function that enables context-dependent selective activation within a deep neural network. Specifically, a neuromodulatory (NM) neural network gates the forward pass of another (otherwise normal) neural network called the prediction learning network (PLN). The NM network also thus indirectly controls selective plasticity (i.e. the backward pass of) the PLN. ANML enables continual learning without catastrophic forgetting at scale: it produces state-of-the-art continual learning performance, sequentially learning as many as 600 classes (over 9,000 SGD updates).},

In this thesis, I propose an approach to continual learning which is based on adaptive state-space quantisation and reinforcement learning. Representational tools for continual learning should be constructive, as the learning task is not known a priori, and allow the transfer of information between related tasks. The proposed learning method uses constructive neural networks and instance-based learning to compute a task-dependent agent-internal state space that can be adapted to new learning tasks easily. The continual learning method has been applied to a mobile robot that had to learn navigation tasks in different environments. This scenario is challenging as the performance feedback is sparse and the interaction with the environment is non-deterministic. I provide a performance comparison of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for the robot navigation task and evaluate the capability of the learning system to adapt to changes in the operating environment. Although only experiments dealing with change to the environment are reported, the methods developed in the thesis are intended for more general multi-task-learning. It is hoped that the learning method will lead to a speed-up in applications of reinforcement learning and enable an autonomous robot to adapt its behaviour during its entire lifetime.},

A number of methods, using various model expansion strategies, have been proposed recently as possible solutions. However, determining how much to expand the model is left to the practitioner, and typically a constant schedule is chosen for simplicity, regardless of how complex the incoming task is. Instead, we propose a principled Bayesian nonparametric approach based on the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior, letting the data determine how much to expand the model complexity. We pair this with a factorization of the neural network's weight matrices. Such an approach allows us to scale the number of factors of each weight matrix to the complexity of the task, while the IBP prior imposes weight factor sparsity and encourages factor reuse, promoting positive knowledge transfer between tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a number of continual learning benchmarks and analyze how weight factors are allocated and reused throughout the training.},

Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development. References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology–a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks are used in many state-of-the-art systems for machine perception. Once a network is trained to do a specific task, e.g., bird classification, it cannot easily be trained to do new tasks, e.g., incrementally learning to recognize additional bird species or learning an entirely different task such as flower recognition. When new tasks are added, typical deep neural networks are prone to catastrophically forgetting previous tasks. Networks that are capable of assimilating new information incrementally, much like how humans form new memories over time, will be more efficient than re-training the model from scratch each time a new task needs to be learned. There have been multiple attempts to develop schemes that mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but these methods have not been directly compared, the tests used to evaluate them vary considerably, and these methods have only been evaluated on small-scale problems (e.g., MNIST). In this paper, we introduce new metrics and benchmarks for directly comparing five different mechanisms designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in neural networks: regularization, ensembling, rehearsal, dual-memory, and sparse-coding. Our experiments on real-world images and sounds show that the mechanism(s) that are critical for optimal performance vary based on the incremental training paradigm and type of data being used, but they all demonstrate that the catastrophic forgetting problem is not yet solved.},

abstract = {A continual learning agent should be able to build on top of existing knowledge to learn on new data quickly while minimizing forgetting. Current intelligent systems based on neural network function approximators arguably do the opposite-they are highly prone to forgetting and rarely trained to facilitate future learning. One reason for this poor behavior is that they learn from a representation that is not explicitly trained for these two goals. In this paper, we propose OML, an objective that directly minimizes catastrophic interference by learning representations that accelerate future learning and are robust to forgetting under online updates in continual learning. We show that it is possible to learn naturally sparse representations that are more effective for online updating. Moreover, our algorithm is complementary to existing continual learning strategies, such as MER and GEM. Finally, we demonstrate that a basic online updating strategy on representations learned by OML is competitive with rehearsal based methods for continual learning. 1},

The issue of forgetting the previously learned tasks in continual learning is known as catastrophic forgetting or interference. When the input data or the goal of learning change, a continual model will learn and adapt to the new status. However, the model will not remember or recognise any revisits to the previous states. This causes performance reduction and re-training curves in dealing with periodic or irregularly reoccurring changes in the data or goals. The changes in goals or data are referred to as new tasks in a continual learning model. Most of the continual learning methods have a task-known setup in which the task identities are known in advance to the learning model. We propose Task Conditional Neural Networks (TCNN) that does not require to known the reoccurring tasks in advance. We evaluate our model on standard datasets using MNIST and CIFAR10, and also a real-world dataset that we have collected in a remote healthcare monitoring study (i.e. TIHM dataset).

To measure the impact of catastrophic forgetting, the model is tested on all the previous tasks as it completes any task. As a step toward developing true lifelong learning systems, we unify gradient episodic memory (a catastrophic forgetting alleviation approach) and Net2Net (a capacity expansion approach).

In the context of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) this results in poor performance on heterogeneous datasets and on sub-tasks like rare phrase translation. On the other hand, non-parametric approaches are immune to forgetting, perfectly complementing the generalization ability of NMT. However, attempts to combine non-parametric or retrieval based approaches with NMT have only been successful on narrow domains, possibly due to over-reliance on sentence level retrieval. We propose a novel n-gram level retrieval approach that relies on local phrase level similarities, allowing us to retrieve neighbors that are useful for translation even when overall sentence similarity is low. We complement this with an expressive neural network, allowing our model to extract information from the noisy retrieved context. We evaluate our semi-parametric NMT approach on a heterogeneous dataset composed of WMT, IWSLT, JRC-Acquis and OpenSubtitles, and demonstrate gains on all 4 evaluation sets. The semi-parametric nature of our approach opens the door for non-parametric domain adaptation, demonstrating strong inference-time adaptation performance on new domains without the need for any parameter updates.},

In this thesis, I propose an approach to continual learning which is based on adaptive state-space quantisation and reinforcement learning. Representational tools for continual learning should be constructive, as the learning task is not known a priori, and allow the transfer of information between related tasks. The proposed learning method uses constructive neural networks and instance-based learning to compute a task-dependent agent-internal state space that can be adapted to new learning tasks easily. The continual learning method has been applied to a mobile robot that had to learn navigation tasks in different environments. This scenario is challenging as the performance feedback is sparse and the interaction with the environment is non-deterministic. I provide a performance comparison of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for the robot navigation task and evaluate the capability of the learning system to adapt to changes in the operating environment. Although only experiments dealing with change to the environment are reported, the methods developed in the thesis are intended for more general multi-task-learning. It is hoped that the learning method will lead to a speed-up in applications of reinforcement learning and enable an autonomous robot to adapt its behaviour during its entire lifetime.},

This problem interferes with continual learning required for autonomous robots, which learn many tasks incrementally from daily activities. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting, it is important for especially reservoir computing to clarify which neurons should be ﬁred corresponding to each task, since only readout weights are updated according to the degree of ﬁring of neurons. We therefore propose the way to design reservoir computing such that the ﬁring neurons are clearly distinguished from others according to the task to be performed. As a key design feature, we employ fractal network, which has modularity and scalability, to be reservoir layer. In particular, its modularity is fully utilized by designing input layer. As a result, simulations of control tasks using reinforcement learning show that our design mitigates the catastrophic forgetting even when random actions from reinforcement learning prompt parameters to be overwritten. Furthermore, learning multiple tasks with a single network suggests that knowledge for the other tasks can facilitate to learn a new task, unlike the case using completely diﬀerent networks.},

Second, we introduce a new metric measuring how quickly a learner acquires a new skill.

The model, in essence, works by operating in a never-ending process of "guess-and-check", where neurons predict the activity values of one another and then immediately adjust their own activities to make better future predictions. The interactive, iterative nature of our neural system fits well into the continuous time formulation of data sensory stream prediction and, as we show, the model's structure yields a simple, local synaptic update rule, which could be used to complement or replace online spike-timing dependent plasticity. In this article, we experiment with an instantiation of our model that consists of leaky integrate-and-fire units. However, the general framework within which our model is situated can naturally incorporate more complex, formal neurons such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Our experimental results in pattern recognition demonstrate the potential of the proposed model when binary spike trains are the primary paradigm for inter-neuron communication. Notably, our model is competitive in terms of classification performance, can conduct online semi-supervised learning, naturally experiences less forgetting when learning from a sequence of tasks, and is more computationally economical and biologically-plausible than popular artificial neural networks.},

abstract = {The ability to recognize and predict temporal sequences of sensory inputs is vital for survival in natural environments. Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.},

abstract = {Continual learning (CL) is a particular machine learning paradigm where the data distribution and learning objective change through time, or where all the training data and objective criteria are never available at once. The evolution of the learning process is modeled by a sequence of learning experiences where the goal is to be able to learn new skills all along the sequence without forgetting what has been previously learned. CL can be seen as an online learning where knowledge fusion needs to take place in order to learn from streams of data presented sequentially in time. Continual learning also aims at the same time at optimizing the memory, the computation power and the speed during the learning process. An important challenge for machine learning is not necessarily finding solutions that work in the real world but rather finding stable algorithms that can learn in real world. Hence, the ideal approach would be tackling the real world in a embodied platform: an autonomous agent. Continual learning would then be effective in an autonomous agent or robot, which would learn autonomously through time about the external world, and incrementally develop a set of complex skills and knowledge.Robotic agents have to learn to adapt and interact with their environment using a continuous stream of observations. Some recent approaches aim at tackling continual learning for robotics, but most recent papers on continual learning only experiment approaches in simulation or with static datasets. Unfortunately, the evaluation of those algorithms does not provide insights on whether their solutions may help continual learning in the context of robotics. This paper aims at reviewing the existing state of the art of continual learning, summarizing existing benchmarks and metrics, and proposing a framework for presenting and evaluating both robotics and non robotics approaches in a way that makes transfer between both fields easier. We put light on continual learning in the context of robotics to create connections between fields and normalize approaches.},

The resulting network resembles a static entity of knowledge, with endeavours to extend this knowledge without targeting the original task resulting in a catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning shifts this paradigm towards networks that can continually accumulate knowledge over different tasks without the need to retrain from scratch. We focus on task incremental classification, where tasks arrive sequentially and are delineated by clear boundaries. Our main contributions concern 1) a taxonomy and extensive overview of the state-of-the-art, 2) a novel framework to continually determine the stability-plasticity trade-off of the continual learner, 3) a comprehensive experimental comparison of 11 state-of-the-art continual learning methods and 4 baselines.

In order to deal with the possible compromise between model sparsity and performance, we formalize and incorporate the concept of graceful forgetting: the idea that it is preferable to suffer a small amount of forgetting in a controlled manner if it helps regain network capacity and prevents uncontrolled loss of performance during the training of future tasks. CLNP also provides simple continual learning diagnostic tools in terms of the number of free neurons left for the training of future tasks as well as the number of neurons that are being reused. In particular, we see in experiments that CLNP verifies and automatically takes advantage of the fact that the features of earlier layers are more transferable.

In practice one does not want to maintain all past training data and retrain from scratch, but naively updating a model with new data(sets) results in a degradation of already learned tasks, which is referred to as "catastrophic forgetting." We develop a generative replay procedure for generating training audio spectrogram data, in place of keeping older training datasets. We show that by incrementally refining a classifier with generative replay a generator that is 4% of the size of all previous training data matches the performance of refining the classifier keeping 20% of all previous training data. We thus conclude that we can extend a trained sound classifier to learn new classes without having to keep previously used datasets.},

abstract = {Artificial autonomous agents and robots interacting in complex environments are required to continually acquire and fine-tune knowledge over sustained periods of time. The ability to learn from continuous streams of information is referred to as lifelong learning and represents a long-standing challenge for neural network models due to catastrophic forgetting in which novel sensory experience interferes with existing representations and leads to abrupt decreases in the performance on previously acquired knowledge. Computational models of lifelong learning typically alleviate catastrophic forgetting in experimental scenarios with given datasets of static images and limited complexity, thereby differing significantly from the conditions artificial agents are exposed to. In more natural settings, sequential information may become progressively available over time and access to previous experience may be restricted. Therefore, specialized neural network mechanisms are required that adapt to novel sequential experience while preventing disruptive interference with existing representations. In this paper, we propose a dual-memory self-organizing architecture for lifelong learning scenarios. The architecture comprises two growing recurrent networks with the complementary tasks of learning object instances (episodic memory) and categories (semantic memory). Both growing networks can expand in response to novel sensory experience: the episodic memory learns fine-grained spatiotemporal representations of object instances in an unsupervised fashion while the semantic memory uses task-relevant signals to regulate structural plasticity levels and develop more compact representations from episodic experience. For the consolidation of knowledge in the absence of external sensory input, the episodic memory periodically replays trajectories of neural reactivations. We evaluate the proposed model on the CORe50 benchmark dataset for continuous object recognition, showing that we significantly outperform current methods of lifelong learning in three different incremental learning scenarios.},

Previous approaches to the problem have considered either the progressive increase in the size of the networks, or have tried to regularize the network behavior to equalize it with respect to previously observed tasks. In the latter case, it is essential to understand what type of information best represents this past behavior. Common techniques include regularizing the past outputs, gradients, or individual weights. In this work, we propose a new, relatively simple and efficient method to perform continual learning by regularizing instead the network internal embeddings. To make the approach scalable, we also propose a dynamic sampling strategy to reduce the memory footprint of the required external storage. We show that our method performs favorably with respect to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, while requiring significantly less space in memory and computational time. In addition, inspired by to recent works, we evaluate the impact of selecting a more flexible model for the activation functions inside the network, evaluating the impact of catastrophic forgetting on the activation functions themselves.},

The use of sparse, orthogonal hidden-layer representations has been shown to reduce catastrophic interference. The author demonstrates that the use of sparse representations may, in certain cases, actually result in worse performance on catastrophic interference. This paper argues for the necessity of maintaining hidden-layer representations that are both as highly distributed and as highly orthogonal as possible. The author presents a learning algorithm, called context-biasing, that dynamically solves the problem of constraining hiddenlayer representations to simultaneously produce good orthogonality and distributedness. On the data tested for this study, context-biasing is shown to reduce catastrophic interference by more than 50% compared to standard backpropagation. In particular, this technique succeeds in reducing catastrophic interference on data where sparse, orthogonal distributions failed to produce any improvement.},

We propose an algorithm that enables a network to learn continually and efficiently by partitioning the representational space into a Core space, that contains the condensed information from previously learned tasks, and a Residual space, which is akin to a scratch space for learning the current task. The information in the Residual space is then compressed using Principal Component Analysis and added to the Core space, freeing up parameters for the next task. We evaluate our algorithm on P-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We achieve comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods while overcoming the problem of catastrophic forgetting completely. Additionally, we get up to 4.5x improvement in energy efficiency during inference due to the structured nature of the resulting architecture.},

This violation, however, is ubiquitous in clinical settings where data are streamed temporally and from a multitude of physiological sensors. To overcome this obstacle, we propose CLOPS, a healthcare-specific replay-based continual learning strategy. In three continual learning scenarios based on three publically-available datasets, we show that CLOPS can outperform its multi-task learning counterpart. Moreover, we propose end-to-end trainable parameters, which we term task-instance parameters, that can be used to quantify task difficulty and similarity. This quantification yields insights into both network interpretability and clinical applications, where task difficulty is poorly quantified.},

abstract = {Temporal models based on recurrent neural networks have proven to be quite powerful in a wide variety of applications. However, training these models often relies on back-propagation through time, which entails unfolding the network over many time steps, making the process of conducting credit assignment considerably more challenging. Furthermore, the nature of back-propagation itself does not permit the use of non-differentiable activation functions and is inherently sequential, making parallelization of the underlying training process difficult. Here, we propose the Parallel Temporal Neural Coding Network (P-TNCN), a biologically inspired model trained by the learning algorithm we call Local Representation Alignment. It aims to resolve the difficulties and problems that plague recurrent networks trained by back-propagation through time. The architecture requires neither unrolling in time nor the derivatives of its internal activation functions. We compare our model and learning procedure to other back-propagation through time alternatives (which also tend to be computationally expensive), including real-time recurrent learning, echo state networks, and unbiased online recurrent optimization. We show that it outperforms these on sequence modeling benchmarks such as Bouncing MNIST, a new benchmark we denote as Bouncing NotMNIST, and Penn Treebank. Notably, our approach can in some instances outperform full back-propagation through time as well as variants such as sparse attentive back-tracking. Significantly, the hidden unit correction phase of P-TNCN allows it to adapt to new datasets even if its synaptic weights are held fixed (zero-shot adaptation) and facilitates retention of prior generative knowledge when faced with a task sequence. We present results that show the P-TNCN's ability to conduct zero-shot adaptation and online continual sequence modeling.},

abstract = {Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and transfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.},

DEN is efﬁciently trained in an online manner by performing selective retraining, dynamically expands network capacity upon arrival of each task with only the necessary number of units, and effectively prevents semantic drift by splitting/duplicating units and timestamping them. We validate DEN on multiple public datasets under lifelong learning scenarios, on which it not only signiﬁcantly outperforms existing lifelong learning methods for deep networks, but also achieves the same level of performance as the batch counterparts with substantially fewer number of parameters. Further, the obtained network ﬁne-tuned on all tasks obtained siginﬁcantly better performance over the batch models, which shows that it can be used to estimate the optimal network structure even when all tasks are available in the ﬁrst place.},

The proposed method is effective without accessing to the old dataset to address the issues of high training cost and old dataset unavailability. To achieve this, knowledge distillation is applied as a guidance to retain the recognition ability from the previous model, which is then combined with the new ASR task for model optimization. With an ASR model pre-trained on 12,000h Mandarin speech, we test our proposed method on 300h new scenario task and 1h new named entities task. Experiments show that our method yields 3.25% and 0.88% absolute Character Error Rate (CER) reduction on the new scenario, when compared with the pre-trained model and the full-data retraining baseline, respectively. It even yields a surprising 0.37% absolute CER reduction on the new scenario than the fine-tuning. For the new named entities task, our method significantly improves the accuracy compared with the pre-trained model, i.e. 16.95% absolute CER reduction. For both of the new task adaptions, the new models still maintain a same accuracy with the baseline on the old tasks.},

abstract = {The human visual system has the remarkably ability to be able to effortlessly learn novel concepts from only a few examples. Mimicking the same behavior on machine learning vision systems is an interesting and very challenging research problem with many practical advantages on real world vision applications. In this context, the goal of our work is to devise a few-shot visual learning system that during test time it will be able to efficiently learn novel categories from only a few training data while at the same time it will not forget the initial categories on which it was trained (here called base categories). To achieve that goal we propose (a) to extend an object recognition system with an attention based few-shot classification weight generator, and (b) to redesign the classifier of a ConvNet model as the cosine similarity function between feature representations and classification weight vectors. The latter, apart from unifying the recognition of both novel and base categories, it also leads to feature representations that generalize better on 'unseen' categories. We extensively evaluate our approach on Mini-ImageNet where we manage to improve the prior state-of-the-art on few-shot recognition (i.e., we achieve 56.20% and 73.00% on the 1-shot and 5-shot settings respectively) while at the same time we do not sacrifice any accuracy on the base categories, which is a characteristic that most prior approaches lack. Finally, we apply our approach on the recently introduced few-shot benchmark of Bharath and Girshick [4] where we also achieve state-of-the-art results.},

While deep neural networks are now widely used by robots for inferring semantic information, conventional neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting when they are incrementally updated, with new knowledge overwriting established representations. While a variety of approaches have been developed that attempt to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in the incremental batch learning scenario, in which an agent learns a large collection of labeled samples at once, streaming learning has been much less studied in the robotics and deep learning communities. In streaming learning, an agent learns instances one-by-one and can be tested at any time. Here, we revisit streaming linear discriminant analysis, which has been widely used in the data mining research community. By combining streaming linear discriminant analysis with deep learning, we are able to outperform both incremental batch learning and streaming learning algorithms on both ImageNet-1K and CORe50.},

abstract = {A continual learning agent should be able to build on top of existing knowledge to learn on new data quickly while minimizing forgetting. Current intelligent systems based on neural network function approximators arguably do the opposite-they are highly prone to forgetting and rarely trained to facilitate future learning. One reason for this poor behavior is that they learn from a representation that is not explicitly trained for these two goals. In this paper, we propose OML, an objective that directly minimizes catastrophic interference by learning representations that accelerate future learning and are robust to forgetting under online updates in continual learning. We show that it is possible to learn naturally sparse representations that are more effective for online updating. Moreover, our algorithm is complementary to existing continual learning strategies, such as MER and GEM. Finally, we demonstrate that a basic online updating strategy on representations learned by OML is competitive with rehearsal based methods for continual learning. 1},

abstract = {Humans have the extraordinary ability to learn continually from experience. Not only we can apply previously learned knowledge and skills to new situations, we can also use these as the foundation for later learning. One of the grand goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is building an artificial “continual learning” agent that constructs a sophisticated understanding of the world from its own experience through the autonomous incremental development of ever more complex knowledge and skills. However, despite early speculations and few pioneering works, very little research and effort has been devoted to address this vision. Current AI systems greatly suffer from the exposure to new data or environments which even slightly differ from the ones for which they have been trained for. Moreover, the learning process is usually constrained on fixed datasets within narrow and isolated tasks which may hardly lead to the emergence of more complex and autonomous intelligent behaviors. In essence, continual learning and adaptation capabilities, while more than often thought as fundamental pillars of every intelligent agent, have been mostly left out of the main AI research focus. In this dissertation, we study the application of these ideas in light of the more recent advances in machine learning research and in the context of deep architectures for AI. We propose a comprehensive and unifying framework for continual learning, new metrics, benchmarks and algorithms, as well as providing substantial experimental evaluations in different supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning tasks.},

abstract = {The ability to grow extra nodes is a potentially useful facility for a self-organising neural network. A network that can add nodes into its map space can approximate the input space more accurately, and often more parsimoniously, than a network with predefined structure and size, such as the Self-Organising Map. In addition, a growing network can deal with dynamic input distributions. Most of the growing networks that have been proposed in the literature add new nodes to support the node that has accumulated the highest error during previous iterations or to support topological structures. This usually means that new nodes are added only when the number of iterations is an integer multiple of some pre-defined constant, $\lambda$. This paper suggests a way in which the learning algorithm can add nodes whenever the network in its current state does not sufficiently match the input. In this way the network grows very quickly when new data is presented, but stops growing once the network has matched the data. This is particularly important when we consider dynamic data sets, where the distribution of inputs can change to a new regime after some time. We also demonstrate the preservation of neighbourhood relations in the data by the network. The new network is compared to an existing growing network, the Growing Neural Gas (GNG), on a artificial dataset, showing how the network deals with a change in input distribution after some time. Finally, the new network is applied to several novelty detection tasks and is compared with both the GNG and an unsupervised form of the Reduced Coulomb Energy network on a robotic inspection task and with a Support Vector Machine on two benchmark novelty detection tasks. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As the data amount grows, it becomes infeasible to either store such huge data and repeatedly retrain the model on all data or fine tune the model only on new data without forgetting old expressions. In this paper, we introduce a novel progressive slot filling model, ProgModel. ProgModel consists of a novel context gate that transfers previously learned knowledge to a small size expanded component; and meanwhile enables this new component to be fast trained to learn from new data. As such, ProgModel learns the new knowledge by only using new data at each time and meanwhile preserves the previously learned expressions. Our experiments show that ProgModel needs much less training time and smaller model size to outperform various model fine tuning competitors by up to 4.24% and 3.03% on two benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {In order to solve the “sensitivity-stability” problem — and its immediate correlate, the problem of sequential learning — it is crucial to develop connectionist architectures that are simultaneously sensitive to, but not excessively disrupted by, new input. French (1992) suggested that to alleviate a particularly severe form of this disruption, catastrophic forgetting, it was necessary for networks to dynamically separate their internal representations during learning. McClelland, McNaughton, & O'Reilly (1995) went even further. They suggested that nature's way of implementing this obligatory separation was the evolution of two separate areas of the brain, the hippocampus and the neocortex. In keeping with this idea of radical separation, a “pseudo-recurrent” memory model is presented here that partitions a connectionist network into two functionally distinct, but continually interacting areas. One area serves as a final-storage area for representations; the other is an early-processing area where new representations are first learned by the system. The final-storage area continually supplies internally generated patterns (pseudopatterns, Robins (1995)), which are approximations of its content, to the early-processing area, where they are interleaved with the new patterns to be learned. Transfer of the new learning is done either by weight-copying from the early-processing area to the final-storage area or by pseudopattern transfer. A number of experiments are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, allowing, in particular, effective sequential learning with gradual forgetting in the presence of new input. Finally, it is shown that the two interacting areas automatically produce representational compaction and it is suggested that similar representational streamlining may exist in the brain.},

CF has recently received renewed attention in the case of feed-forward DNNs, and this article is the first work that aims to rigorously establish whether deep LSTM networks are afflicted by CF as well, and to what degree. In order to test this fully, training is conducted using a wide variety of high-dimensional image-based sequence classification tasks derived from established visual classification benchmarks (MNIST, Devanagari, FashionMNIST and EMNIST). We find that the CF effect occurs universally, without exception, for deep LSTM-based sequence classifiers, regardless of the construction and provenance of sequences. This leads us to conclude that LSTMs, just like DNNs, are fully affected by CF, and that further research work needs to be conducted in order to determine how to avoid this effect (which is not a goal of this study).},

One of the main objectives of this work is to fill these gaps so as to provide a common ground for better understanding of il. The main challenge for an il algorithm is to update the classifier whilst preserving existing knowledge. We observe that, in addition to forgetting, a known issue while preserving knowledge, il also suffers from a problem we call intransigence, its inability to update knowledge. We introduce two metrics to quantify forgetting and intransigence that allow us to understand, analyse, and gain better insights into the behaviour of il algorithms. Furthermore, we present RWalk, a generalization of ewc++ (our efficient version of ewc [6]) and Path Integral [25] with a theoretically grounded KL-divergence based perspective. We provide a thorough analysis of various il algorithms on MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets. In these experiments, RWalk obtains superior results in terms of accuracy, and also provides a better trade-off for forgetting and intransigence.},

abstract = {The impressive lifelong learning in animal brains is primarily enabled by plastic changes in synaptic connectivity. Importantly, these changes are not passive, but are actively controlled by neuromodulation, which is itself under the control of the brain. The resulting self-modifying abilities of the brain play an important role in learning and adaptation, and are a major basis for biological reinforcement learning. Here we show for the first time that artificial neural networks with such neuromodulated plasticity can be trained with gradient descent. Extending previous work on differentiable Hebbian plasticity, we propose a differentiable formulation for the neuromodulation of plasticity. We show that neuromodulated plasticity improves the performance of neural networks on both reinforcement learning and supervised learning tasks. In one task, neuromodulated plastic LSTMs with millions of parameters outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task (controlling for the number of parameters). We conclude that differentiable neuromodulation of plasticity offers a powerful new framework for training neural networks.},

abstract = {We present a large-scale empirical study of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in modern Deep Neural Network (DNN) models that perform sequential (or: incremen-tal) learning. A new experimental protocol is proposed that enforces typical constraints encountered in application scenarios. As the investigation is empirical, we evaluate CF behavior on the hitherto largest number of visual classification datasets, from each of which we construct a representative number of Sequential Learning Tasks (SLTs) in close alignment to previous works on CF. Our results clearly indicate that there is no model that avoids CF for all investigated datasets and SLTs under application conditions. We conclude with a discussion of potential solutions and workarounds to CF, notably for the EWC and IMM models.},
