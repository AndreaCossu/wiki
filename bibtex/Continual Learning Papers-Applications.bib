abstract = {This paper proposes a method for performing continual learning of predictive models that facilitate the inference of future frames in video sequences. For a first given experience, an initial Variational Autoencoder, together with a set of fully connected neural networks are utilized to respectively learn the appearance of video frames and their dynamics at the latent space level. By employing an adapted Markov Jump Particle Filter, the proposed method recognizes new situations and integrates them as predictive models avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. For evaluating the proposed method, this article uses video sequences from a vehicle that performs different tasks in a controlled environment.},

abstract = {â€  We propose an incremental learning for end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to extend the model's capacity on a new task while retaining the performance on existing ones. The proposed method is effective without accessing to the old dataset to address the issues of high training cost and old dataset unavailability. To achieve this, knowledge distillation is applied as a guidance to retain the recognition ability from the previous model, which is then combined with the new ASR task for model optimization. With an ASR model pre-trained on 12,000h Mandarin speech, we test our proposed method on 300h new scenario task and 1h new named entities task. Experiments show that our method yields 3.25% and 0.88% absolute Character Error Rate (CER) reduction on the new scenario, when compared with the pre-trained model and the full-data retraining baseline, respectively. It even yields a surprising 0.37% absolute CER reduction on the new scenario than the fine-tuning. For the new named entities task, our method significantly improves the accuracy compared with the pre-trained model, i.e. 16.95% absolute CER reduction. For both of the new task adaptions, the new models still maintain a same accuracy with the baseline on the old tasks.},

abstract = {While end-to-end neural conversation models have led to promising advances in reducing hand-crafted features and errors induced by the traditional complex system architecture, they typically require an enormous amount of data due to the lack of modularity. Previous studies adopted a hybrid approach with knowledge-based components either to abstract out domain-specific information or to augment data to cover more diverse patterns. On the contrary, we propose to directly address the problem using recent developments in the space of continual learning for neural models. Specifically, we adopt a domain-independent neural conversational model and introduce a novel neural continual learning algorithm that allows a conversational agent to accumulate skills across different tasks in a data-efficient way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies continual learning to conversation systems. We verified the efficacy of our method through a conversational skill transfer from either synthetic dialogs or human-human dialogs to human-computer conversations in a customer support domain.},

abstract = {Continual Learning has been often framed as the problem of training a model in a sequence of tasks. In this regard, Neural Networks have been attested to forget the solutions to previous task as they learn new ones. Yet, modelling human life-long learning does not necessarily require any crisp notion of tasks. In this work, we propose a benchmark based on language modelling in a multilingual and multidomain setting that prescinds of any explicit delimitation of training examples into distinct tasks, and propose metrics to study continual learning and catastrophic forgetting in this setting. Then, we introduce a simple Product of Experts learning system that performs strongly on this problem while displaying interesting properties, and investigate its merits for avoiding forgetting.},

@article{Xue2019a,
abstract = {Recently, data-driven based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved state-of-the-art results. And transfer learning is often used when those existing systems are adapted to the target domain, e.g., fine-tuning, retraining. However, in the processes, the system parameters may well deviate too much from the previously learned parameters. Thus, it is difficult for the system training process to learn knowledge from target domains meanwhile not forgetting knowledge from the previous learning process, which is called as catastrophic forgetting (CF). In this paper, we attempt to solve the CF problem with the lifelong learning and propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) training framework for ASR. It considers reserving original knowledge and learning new knowledge as two independent tasks, respectively. On the one hand, we constrain the new parameters not to deviate too far from the original parameters and punish the new system when forgetting original knowledge. On the other hand, we force the new system to solve new knowledge quickly. Then, a MTL mechanism is employed to get the balance between the two tasks. We applied our method to an End2End ASR task and obtained the best performance in both target and original datasets.},
