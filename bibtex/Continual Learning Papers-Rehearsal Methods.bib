abstract = {Training large language representation models has become a standard in the natural language processing community. This allows for fine tuning on any number of specific tasks, however, these large high capacity models can continue to train on domain specific unlabeled data to make initialization even more robust for supervised tasks. We demonstrate that in practice these pre-trained models present performance deterioration in the form of catastrophic forgetting when evaluated on tasks from a general domain such as GLUE. In this work we propose CALM, Continuous Adaptive Learning for Language Modeling: techniques to render models which retain knowledge across multiple domains. With these methods, we are able to reduce the performance gap across supervised tasks introduced by task specific models which we demonstrate using a continual learning setting in biomedical and clinical domains.},

@article{Kiyasseh2020,
abstract = {Deep learning algorithms are known to experience destructive interference when instances violate the assumption of being independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). This violation, however, is ubiquitous in clinical settings where data are streamed temporally and from a multitude of physiological sensors. To overcome this obstacle, we propose CLOPS, a healthcare-specific replay-based continual learning strategy. In three continual learning scenarios based on three publically-available datasets, we show that CLOPS can outperform its multi-task learning counterpart. Moreover, we propose end-to-end trainable parameters, which we term task-instance parameters, that can be used to quantify task difficulty and similarity. This quantification yields insights into both network interpretability and clinical applications, where task difficulty is poorly quantified.},
