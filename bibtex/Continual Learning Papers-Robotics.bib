abstract = {Continual learning (CL) is a particular machine learning paradigm where the data distribution and learning objective change through time, or where all the training data and objective criteria are never available at once. The evolution of the learning process is modeled by a sequence of learning experiences where the goal is to be able to learn new skills all along the sequence without forgetting what has been previously learned. CL can be seen as an online learning where knowledge fusion needs to take place in order to learn from streams of data presented sequentially in time. Continual learning also aims at the same time at optimizing the memory, the computation power and the speed during the learning process. An important challenge for machine learning is not necessarily finding solutions that work in the real world but rather finding stable algorithms that can learn in real world. Hence, the ideal approach would be tackling the real world in a embodied platform: an autonomous agent. Continual learning would then be effective in an autonomous agent or robot, which would learn autonomously through time about the external world, and incrementally develop a set of complex skills and knowledge.Robotic agents have to learn to adapt and interact with their environment using a continuous stream of observations. Some recent approaches aim at tackling continual learning for robotics, but most recent papers on continual learning only experiment approaches in simulation or with static datasets. Unfortunately, the evaluation of those algorithms does not provide insights on whether their solutions may help continual learning in the context of robotics. This paper aims at reviewing the existing state of the art of continual learning, summarizing existing benchmarks and metrics, and proposing a framework for presenting and evaluating both robotics and non robotics approaches in a way that makes transfer between both fields easier. We put light on continual learning in the context of robotics to create connections between fields and normalize approaches.},

abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots should be able to learn incrementally and adapt to changes in the operating environment during their entire lifetime. This is referred to as continual learning. In this thesis, I propose an approach to continual learning which is based on adaptive state-space quantisation and reinforcement learning. Representational tools for continual learning should be constructive, as the learning task is not known a priori, and allow the transfer of information between related tasks. The proposed learning method uses constructive neural networks and instance-based learning to compute a task-dependent agent-internal state space that can be adapted to new learning tasks easily. The continual learning method has been applied to a mobile robot that had to learn navigation tasks in different environments. This scenario is challenging as the performance feedback is sparse and the interaction with the environment is non-deterministic. I provide a performance comparison of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for the robot navigation task and evaluate the capability of the learning system to adapt to changes in the operating environment. Although only experiments dealing with change to the environment are reported, the methods developed in the thesis are intended for more general multi-task-learning. It is hoped that the learning method will lead to a speed-up in applications of reinforcement learning and enable an autonomous robot to adapt its behaviour during its entire lifetime.},
