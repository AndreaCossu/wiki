abstract = {We present a systematic study of Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), i.e., the abrupt loss of previously acquired knowledge, when retraining deep recurrent LSTM networks with new samples. CF has recently received renewed attention in the case of feed-forward DNNs, and this article is the first work that aims to rigorously establish whether deep LSTM networks are afflicted by CF as well, and to what degree. In order to test this fully, training is conducted using a wide variety of high-dimensional image-based sequence classification tasks derived from established visual classification benchmarks (MNIST, Devanagari, FashionMNIST and EMNIST). We find that the CF effect occurs universally, without exception, for deep LSTM-based sequence classifiers, regardless of the construction and provenance of sequences. This leads us to conclude that LSTMs, just like DNNs, are fully affected by CF, and that further research work needs to be conducted in order to determine how to avoid this effect (which is not a goal of this study).},

@book{Hebb2005a,
abstract = {Since its publication in 1949, D.O. Hebb's, The Organization of Behavior has been one of the most influential books in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists–the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field. The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks. D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development. References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology–a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},
